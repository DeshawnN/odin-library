# Instructions
Adding Books:

To add books, simply hit the Add book button, and enter your book information at the prompts.

Editing Book Information fields:

You can edit the title, author and page information of the books in your library by clicking on the field you want to change and updating it in the prompt, please enjoy my very sloppy implementation of Vanilla JS data-binding.
